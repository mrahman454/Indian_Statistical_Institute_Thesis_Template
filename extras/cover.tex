\title{Cryptanalysis of Symmetric Key Schemes using Classical and Quantum Techniques}

\author{Mostafizar Rahman}
% If you wish to list your previous degrees on the cover page, use the 
% previous degrees command:
%       \prevdegrees{A.A., Harvard University (1985)}
% You can use the \\ command to list multiple previous degrees
%       \prevdegrees{B.S., University of California (1978) \\
%                    S.M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1981)}
\department{Cryptology and Security Research Unit}

% If the thesis is for two degrees simultaneously, list them both
% separated by \and like this:
% \degree{Doctor of Philosophy \and Master of Science}
\degree{Ph.D. in Computer Science}

% As of the 2007-08 academic year, valid degree months are September, 
% February, or June.  The default is June.

%% By default, the thesis will be copyrighted to MIT.  If you need to copyright

% If there is more than one supervisor, use the \supervisor command
% once for each.

% This is the department committee chairman, not the thesis committee
% chairman.  You should replace this with your Department's Committee

% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.  The dotted
% lines for the signatures are made with the \signature command.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\maketitle

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.
